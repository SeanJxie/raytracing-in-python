# raytracing-in-python
A raytracer I implemented following [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) by Peter Shirley.

Why's it written in Python and not in C++ as indended? I like Python. I didn't want to get caught up in memory management bugs for hours.

Is it slow? Yes. Very, very, very slow. I paid the appropriate price.
